# What is a social security number?

The Social Security Number (SSN) is a unique identification number assigned to each person. A SSN is issued by the Social Security Administration (SSA) of the US government and is used to identify individuals for a variety of purposes including tax reporting and benefits.

An SSN may be needed for a variety of reasons, such as applying for a job, getting a loan, or opening a bank account. In the United States, the SSN is a 9-digit number that consists of three parts: the first digit, the last four digits, and the hyphen.

## The SSN Numbering Scheme

The Social Security Number (SSN) is a 9-digit identification number used by the US government for taxation purposes. The three-digit area code, followed by the two-digit group number, and finally, the four-digit serial number is used to identify each citizen in the United States.

## What SSN is used for?

ðŸ”Ž Authenticating Identity And Preventing Fraud
ðŸ›¡ Protecting The Government From People Trying To Steal Their Money
ðŸ†˜ Helping Employers Identify Workers
ðŸ“ƒ Helping The Government Identify Taxpayers
ðŸ’¸  Making It Easier For You To Get A Loan
ðŸ›„  A Social Security Number Can Also Help You Get A Job Or Keep Your Job.

## How Social Security Numbers Work

The Social Security Administration (SSA) is the federal agency that issues social security numbers.  Every person in the United States is assigned a social security number. The number is assigned to a person at birth, and it remains the same throughout his or her life.

The Social Security Administration issues numbers in a specific order. The first digit is always either 7 or 8.  The last four digits are also important because they are used to identify the area in which a person lives. The area code is three digits long. The last two digits are a group number.

## Why Do People Need Social Security Numbers?

## Group Number 

Paired with the Area number, the Group number can be used to determine when a particular block of Social Security Numbers was issued prior to the randomization. For each Area number, Group numbers were issued in the following order:

> Odd numbers 00 to 09
Even numbers 10 to 98
Even numbers 02 to 08
Odd numbers 11 to 99
00 is invalid

The Group numbers were used at different rates based on demand for Social Security Numbers in each areas.

## Series Number

The Series number is used to ensure all issued Social Security Numbers are unique. For each Group number used the series numbers are issued sequentially from 0001 to 9999. Series number 0000 is invalid.
