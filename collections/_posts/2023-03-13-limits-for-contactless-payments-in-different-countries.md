LIMITS FOR CONTACTLESS PAYMENTS IN DIFFERENTS COUNTRIES

As you know, we call contactless payments that are made either using cards or through mobile applications and digital wallets. The payment transaction is only possible at a distance of two to four inches (4 cm), which ensures that the withdrawal decision is targeted.

The most popular and commonly used types of contactless payments are contactless debit and credit cards. Inside, they contain a small antenna that enables wireless communication with the reader. These cards usually have a magnetic stripe and a chip, so they can be used in more traditional ways if the store doesn't have an appropriate card reader. 

Other popular contactless payment methods are mobile apps. They allow you to replace a credit or debit card. To use them, you need to enable contactless payment on your smartphone, download the necessary applications, link cards and accounts.

Depending on your bank or the country you are located in, there may be a limit on the amount you can spend on a transaction without entering your PIN. In general, such a limit, on the one hand, can be perceived as complicating the ease of use of contactless payments. 

However, it increases the level of security, because thanks to this, the fraudster will not be able to spend too much from your account. Contactless payment limits differ from country to country. Power and financial institutions set their own limits. Many European countries have announced increases in contactless restrictions in response to the spread of COVID-19. Let's take a closer look at what these limits are.

United Kingdom ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§

Contactless cards appeared in England in 2007. During this time, the payment limit has gradually increased from Â£ 10 to Â£ 100. The decision to raise the bar to Â£ 100 was made by the Treasury and the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) in October this year in response to increased use of contactless payments amid the pandemic. 

The authorities hope that this will make this form of payment attractive, facilitate social distancing, and help avoid human contact with potentially contaminated items. Meanwhile, digital banks Starling and Lloyds Bank allow their customers to set their own contactless limit.

North America  ðŸŒŽ

Neither the United States nor Canada has set contactless limits, leaving them to the discretion of financial institutions. 

For example, in the US, Visa, Mastercard and Discover have set their limits at $ 100, and American Express at $ 200. In Canada, Mastercard, Visa and American Express have fixed a limit of C $ 250, while Interac has a C $ 100 limit.

France ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡·

The French Banking Federation (FBF) has raised the limit from 30 to 50 euros due to the pandemic. 

At the same time, according to some studies, 37% of French consumers believe that the restriction should be lifted altogether.

Ireland ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡ª

In 2021, the limit on contactless card payments in Ireland has increased to 50 euros. Previously, owner authentication was not required for purchases under â‚¬ 30. The decision was made by the authorities for the same purpose - to encourage contactless payments and reduce the spread of coronavirus.

Netherlands ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡±

The increase in contactless payment limits from â‚¬ 50 to  100 â‚¬ was part of the emergency measures taken in the country to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.

Norway ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡´

Norwegian banks have also raised the contactless limit from NOK 400 ($ 48) to NOK 500 ($ 60) to prevent the spread of the disease.

India ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³

Since January 1, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has allowed customers to use contactless payments with both debit and credit cards, without owner authentication, up to Rs 5,000 ($ 65). Prior to that, the limit was Rs 2,000 ($ 26).

Singapore ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡¬

In Singapore, cardholder authentication for payment is not required for purchases under $ 200.

Ukraine ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¦

In Ukraine, a limit of UAH 500 is set for payments by Mastercard. In April last year, Visa announced an increase in the ceiling for contactless transactions from UAH 1,000 to UAH 1,500.

SwitzerlandðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡­

In Switzerland, the contactless payment was set by Mastercard, Visa and Maestro to 40 CHF ($ 40) and has been changed to 80 CHF ($ 80).
