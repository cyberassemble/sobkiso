# HOW TO DIAGNOSE RAM

While the computer is running, RAM contains data from the OS, running programs, as well as input, output, and intermediate data processed by the processor. If there is a problem with RAM, everything will work badly.

[MemTest86](https://www.memtest86.com/) is a free program that allows you to check the RAM of a computer or laptop for errors and problems in operation. The peculiarity of the utility is that it does not run in the operating system, but as a separate image that must be written to a USB flash drive and launched from the BIOS.

This way of launching has its advantages: the program can test all the RAM, and the operating system will not interfere with it. If the operating system does not start or malfunctions, then you can find out if everything is fine with the memory.

The program first writes the entire memory by repeating the prepared data block, then reads and compares what was written with what was read in two passes: starting from low addresses to high ones and vice versa. The procedure is repeated for many different data samples in order to identify all possible errors.

Best of all, if you check the memory, you will be one module at a time. That is, we open the computer, remove all the RAM modules, except for one, and perform its check. After the end - the next and so on. In this way, it will be possible to accurately identify the failed module.
