# DRIVER LICENSE GUIDE

You need to split the DL number in 5.

For the example, we gonna take this identity: Michel Beaudoin, 22 may 1946

DL Number is: B3506-220546-02

1️⃣ B (The first letter of the last name)

2️⃣ 350 (The 3 first consonante into the last name) — (See the list bellow). If it doesn't have 3 consonante, you patch with the number 0. If it have 2 consonantes or more back to back, just pickup one and continue to the next. This 2 letter are also not codifiable like the consinante: H & W

List of the consonante:

1 ➡️ B,F,P,V
2 ➡️ C,G,K,J,Q,S,X,Z
3 ➡️ D,T
4 ➡️ L
5 ➡️ M,N
6 ➡️ R

3️⃣ 6 (This is the first letter of the first name using this condification list:

1 ➡️ A,B
2 ➡️ C
3 ➡️ D,E,F
4 ➡️ G,H,I
5 ➡️ J,K,L
6 ➡️ M,N,O
7 ➡️ P,Q,R
8 ➡️ S,T
9 ➡️ U,V,W,X,Y,Z

4️⃣ 220546 (This is the DOB in this format: DD/MM/YY)

5️⃣ This is a sequantiel number using only by the SAAQ with an internal code using to separate the same last, first and surname with people whi have the same DOB into the system. To find this number, you will need to use the next tools and try start by 01 up to 99 (Majority of the time, you will never go up 20. Also, the next tools is necessary to get the expiration date.


Confirm the DL and find the missing 2 digits.

Go to: https://saaq.gouv.qc.ca/en/online-services/citizens/checking-validity-drivers-licence/

Access the online service

Put the DL information starting by 01 (B3506-220546-01) where is requested the Driver's licence number.

Press NEXT.

If you get this message: The driver's licence number entered cannot be found in our records. (GDIW127) its because the last 2 digits is not good. Just change 01 by 02 and do it again. Try up to the moment the system accept the number and put you on the payment page to check the validity.

NOW, if you want to know the expiration date, when you will be on the payment page, you need to buy the service. it will cost 1.65$, you can use any card from canada. You can re-use it up to the moment the card is kill.

When you will get the DL checkup, it will say the expiration date. So, the delivrance dat will be the exact same date but 4 years before.

At the end, you know the DL, Exp and delivrance date!

CONCERNING THE HC (Assurance Maladie du Quebec)

This is really simple, only use this algorith:

1 — BEA (First 3 letter of the last name)
2 — M (First letter of the first name)
3 — 460522 (The dob in this format YY/MM/DD)
4 — 00 (This is a internal code)

It have no way to know the last 2 digits but it will be never used by any institution. Compagny like canadian tire use the HC card for accept application to the credit card in store. Its because he only take the first information + the name. Noboddy use the last 2 digit so you can put anything. I personally put 12 all time...

So the official HC number of my example will be:

BEAM46052212

You can put any expiration date.
