**About Tiktok**

TikTok and Douyin have almost the same user interface but no access to each other's content. Their servers are each based in the market where the respective app is available. The two products are similar, but their features are not identical. Douyin includes an in-video search feature that can search by people's faces for more videos of them, along with other features such as buying, booking hotels, and making geo-tagged reviews.

Since their launches, TikTok and Douyin have gained global popularity. In October 2020, TikTok surpassed 2 billion mobile downloads worldwide. Morning Consult named TikTok the third-fastest growing brand of 2020, after Zoom and Peacock. Cloudflare ranked TikTok the most popular website of 2021, surpassing google.com.

TikTok has been subject to criticism over psychological effects such as addiction, as well as controversies regarding inappropriate content, misinformation, censorship, moderation, and user privacy.

**It’s official:** TikTok is no longer a lip-syncing app for teenagers. As the third biggest social media platform in the world, it’s a gold mine for conversions: if you know how to drive traffic from TikTok to your website.

The only problem?  It’s not that easy to get people off the app.

Unlike Instagram, there is no ‘Swipe Up’ or link sticker or built-in e-commerce shopping features. All you have is one link in your bio.

The good news is, if you know how to use it wisely, one link is all you need to turn TikTok into a traffic driving machine.

Whether you’re looking to get more clicks or more sales, use these five easy strategies to drive more traffic from TikTok.

![Here I present a manual for working with traffic from Tik-Tok]("/assets/images/blog/images.jpeg)

## Here I present a manual for working with traffic from Tik-Tok. 

This is the initial stage of knowledge that is necessary to get traffic to your projects. There will be no emphasis on any particular project, but on the base that fits all niches (projects). In general, this is what works and no one will talk about it, I did not find a single good article or even a chapter that even described parts of what I wrote about.

In connection with the sanctions on some of the CIS countries, most people who transferred traffic to telegram channels from Tik-Tok lost their earnings. In this regard, I decided to show you a method that can be used to get traffic from Tik-Tok. There will be no links shown here, there will be an emphasis on the technical part, on some pitfalls, etc. Only thanks to this information, you will already be able to understand the basic principles of working with attracting traffic from Tik-Tok outside the CIS.

All links indicated in the article are not advertising, but only what I personally checked! I also added video tutorials on working with antidetect browsers ( ps are not mine ). If there are similar articles on the forum, write to me and I will ask them to remove them)

All material is provided for informational purposes only!

Base For Work

## With Logs

1. Antidetect Browser ~ Dolphin Anty | 1000 free profiles for 4 days ( anty.dolphin.ru.com/ru )
2. Logs Tik-Tok account ~ login:password or cookies | You can find them: on the Market, from logs or from the sellers.
3. Individual proxies : ipv4
-  @Proxysoxybot - tg ( opt )
-  922proxy.com ( opt )

## With Autoregistration

1. Antidetect browser - Incogniton | 10 free profiles ( incogniton.com/ru )
2. To create Tik-Tok accounts:
-  Gmail mail with 6+ months, for autoregistration
-  Farm cookies ( Simplifies your work - https://trafficcardinal.com/post/kak-nagulyat-cookies )
3. Individual proxy ipv4 (from 1 month):
-  proxy6.net
-  proxyline.net

## Creatives (Video for the strait):

-  You should definitely have a good camera (slippers with 8 pixels is a waste of time, it's better to order on the forum, in the work and services section)
-  You must have a clear TOR for the video (a clear understanding of what the target action needs to be done by the user)
-  Video must be within 30 seconds and this is the maximum (the longer the video, the less inspections = less output to the rivers)
-  Music must be trending (open any music chart, tiktok music trends, etc.)
-  The more diverse the creatives, the more often the video will be in trends

## Video uniqueizer:

-  uniq.gmbl.ng (1~10 at a time)
-  @clicklead_media_bot (for times 1~20) Telegram.

In order to make one video - a lot!

## Convector (installation):

My creatives use the CapCut convector, which is enough to add text, music and effects. (Download - capcut.ru ) 

**Logs:**

1. Register for a trial on Dolphin Anty
2. Download and install it
3. Buy a proxy
4. Buy/find logs Tik-Tok
5. Install profile

## Creation of creative:

1. First, create a creative (video), for example, take 10 pieces
2. Add the necessary text (tags, info, call to action, etc.)
3. Uniqueize the video
4. Next, just add music and effects (absolutely random, no repetition!) 
 
## Suggestion for description:

- The description should characterize the action in the video, there should not be any links to the site, bots, etc.!
- The more correctly the description for the customer is written, the more profit
- I do not recommend using text randomization, they have a very good anti-fraud system 

## Recommendation for Hashtag:

- Choose the main hashtags for your project, the more hashtags the better
- For 1 video, use 3-5 main hashtags
- See the rest of the hashtags in trends, on the Tik-Tok trending site and alternate them: 2-3 trend - 1 is yours; 2 of yours at the beginning - a trend - 2 of yours at the end. etc.(showed only an example of working with variations)
- Put no more than 10 hashtags on the video


The allowable length of the description is up to 150 characters with spaces . You can enter nicknames and domain names, but you cannot add full links to the site or other social networks. You can also use emojis and hashtags (they count towards the total volume).

# Login in TikTok

## Logs:

1. Loading cookies in the profile
2. You go through them to TikTok
3. Upload a video and add a description, hashtags
4. Publish

## Autoregistrations:

1. First of all, log in to gmail
2. Next, create an account via gmail in Tik-Tok and fill out the profile
3. We warm the account for 1+ days (Ps Who does not do this, he does not receive anything)
4. After warming up the account, we post the first video. It should not hit the target right away (ps I will give you one chip. If the project is for a crypt, then make some cuts from trading, and then think for yourself)
5. Next, you need to publish videos no more than 1-2 times a day (Ps Such an account will most likely fall into rivers)

## This is when on your account:

- Minimal views on the video (especially if before that they scored more than 1k+)
- No one subscribes to your channel (Either bad content and video quality, or a shadowban)
- Your comments are automatically deleted by the system under other people's videos


> What can you get a "Shadow Ban" for?:

- Cheat
- Private spam | 10-20 messages
- Massliking | For subscriptions from 200; for likes from 500
- Spam in comments | from 30 comments


All these restrictions are given for 1 day. Of course, if you just registered an account and did not make any warm-up and immediately started doing the maximum, then you will fly into TB with 100% probability. In general, this is only part of what TB can get on Tik-Tok, in general, any suspicious mass actions entail TB

Most of all, this information will be useful to those who make auto-registration bays. There are no exact deadlines for the expiration of TB, but usually it is given + - 14 days (depending on the cause of TB). In this case, it would be best to leave this account in bed.

I will not merge here some kind of super scheme, like: turn the monitor three times, say a spell and put 100 dollars under the pillow and tomorrow morning the video will fall into the river. No. There are no super secret schemes for getting into the rivers, but there are moments that affect them:

- high-quality proxies (mandatory individual ipv4)
- quality logs
- high-quality account warming up
- high-quality creatives, etc.


Well, I think you understand what I mean. That rivers are affected by everything where you can mess up. If you do everything clearly, then going out into the rivers will not be long in coming.

> What I can add from what I have not said yet, but this will be useful to you for work:

- I advise you to keep an excel spreadsheet in order to clearly see which ones: creatives, hashtags, descriptions come in, and which ones need to be changed or removed.
- You should also clearly understand that a super converting link that works for 3-4 days with super traffic may already stop working tomorrow. Therefore, you should always keep an eye on the statistics. This is the big plus of Tik-Tok, constant updates help non-names to get into trends.
- I also want to add that Tik-Tok video automation software is 99% scam or just kill your accounts, sending them to a ban . Tik-Tok has a very good anti-fraud system that improves with each update, calculating various kinds of software preventing them from living.
