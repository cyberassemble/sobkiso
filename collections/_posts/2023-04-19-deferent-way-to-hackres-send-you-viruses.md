DIFFERENT WAYS HACKERS SEND YOU SERVER,VIRUS AND .EXE FILES VIA INTERNET


1️⃣ Binder - Binder is a software which is used to bind orcollaborate the server or virus you have created with some other file like a MP3, JPEG or any other file. You can fool the victim by sending him a song or picture and as soon as he opens the picture or song the Binder also gets open and starts working.

2️⃣ Crypter - A crypter is a tool which changes the binary code of the .exe (virus,RAT etc.)file andapplies many encryptions on it which makes the .exe file undetectable.

3️⃣ Zipping - Another smart way to send files is by putting your server in a Zipped folder and then sending it to the victim. Zipping the file changes the extension of the server from .exe to .zip, which bypasses the file transfer facility of gmail , facebook, yahoo etc..

▪️Use WinRAR & give password of that file, so AntiVirus do not scan file.

4️⃣ Extension - You can change the extension of the Server you want to send as it is not possible to send .exe files,so you can change the extension of .exe to .jpeg, .mp3 etc.  when you save the file and then send it the victim. But in this method you will have to tell the victim to change the extension back to .exe after he/she receives the server.

This method can only be used in cases where the victim is very dumb and has no knowledge of this field. 
A person who is not much interested in cyber security should have knowledge of above mentioned methods as they can be used against anyone.
