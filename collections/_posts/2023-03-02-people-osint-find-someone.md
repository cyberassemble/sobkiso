# HOW TO FIND OUT WHERE SOMEONE WORKS

From searching social media profiles to using a tool like TruthFinder[](https://www.truthfinder.com/), this guide gives you all the information you should need to track down your target's place of employment.

## Perform A Simple Online Search ðŸ†“

One of the free ways to locate a person's job is by performing a Google search for the person's full name. You might be surprised by what comes up! 

If the person is employed by a large company, their name may come up in a press release or news article. Or, if they have their own business, their website may come up in the search.

If you are searching for free services, also check our list of OSINT : 

### Here are a few tips for using Google to find someone's current employer:

- Include quotation marks around the person's name to get more specific results.
- Try to locate social media accounts by searching the person's name in quotes, followed by site:facebook.com, site:linkedin.com, ETC. ==(ex: "Vito Scarletta" site:facebook.com)==
- You're likely going to have the most luck with these two, as most people don't publish much personal information on social media platforms like Snapchat, however, you can always try.
- If you're not finding anything, try adding other keywords such as "employer" "resume" or "work" to see if you can uncover a recent resume they posted online.
- Check the "News" and "Images" tabs for results, in addition to the "All" tab to do even more digging.

## Check Their Linkedin Profile

Another place to look is the person's LinkedIn profile. 

LinkedIn is a social networking site for professionals, so it's a great place to find out where a person works (or has worked in the past). If you don't have a LinkedIn account yourself, you can still view most profiles without one.

## How To Find Someone's Linkedin Without An Account

To locate someone's Linkedin without your own account, go to your favorite search engine (Google is 84% of the US's choice), and search the person's name in quotations followed by site:linkedin.com. 

> Example : "Vito Scarletta" site:linkedin.com

If the person has a public account, chances are, you'll be able to locate their profile.

## How To Find Someone's Linkedin With An Account

First, you'll need to log into your profile (or create one) and simply enter their name in the search bar and hit enter. 

Next, click 'People' to see the full list of people with that name. 

If the person is an existing connection of your's they will display at the top of the list. People you aren't connected with will be further down the list and you may need to connect with them to see their entire profile.

Once you locate their profile, you'll need to scroll down to the experience section to see their job history. 

If they've kept up with their Linkedin profile, this may be the answer you're looking for.

If the person you're looking for doesn't have a LinkedIn profile, that could be a sign that they're not employed. Or, it could just mean that they're not very active on social media.

## Take A Look At Their Facebook Profile

If the person you're trying to find is one of the 2.934 billion active Facebook users, their profile may hold some clues about where they work. Like Linkedin, you may be able to locate their page without an active account.

## How To Find Someone's Facebook Without An Account

Similar to LinkedIn, you can use a search engine (such as Google) to locate someone's Facebook without an account. Just enter the person's name in quotations followed by site:facebook.com. 

> Example : "Vito Scarletta" site:facebook.com

If they have a public profile, you should be able to find it this way.

## How To Find Someone's Facebook With An Account

To find someone's Facebook profile with an account, start your social media search by entering their name in the search bar and hit enter.

Next, click on the 'People' tab to see a list of people with that name. 

If you don't know the person well, or if there are a lot of people with that name, you may need to do some additional sleuthing to find the right profile which may include the need to send a friend request if their account is private. 

You can also define the location where the person lives.

Once you've found the right profile, scroll down to the 'About' section. If the person listed their employer, you'll find their employment history under the 'Work And Education' section.

## Search Public Records ðŸ’¸

If you've tried the methods above and have come up dry, searching public records is a great option for locating a personâ€™s place of employment. 

TruthFinder is a public record search engine meant for this exact use case (and many more).

There are a few ways you can find out where someone works using TruthFinder depending on the information you have. Considering you are looking for someone specific, we'll assume you know the name of the person. So for this example, we'll use the People Search tool, however, you can substitute the name with their contact information such as their cell phone number and use our Reverse Phone Lookup for verifying work information.

## How To Find Where Someone Works With Their SSN

If you know the person's Social Security Number (SSN) and you are an employer, you can use that to locate their current employer for W2 purposes. To obtain this information, you first need to register for the SSA's Business Services Online  : [](https://www.ssa.gov/bso/bsowelcome.htm)

Once you've registered, the Social Security Administration will verify your identity and provide you with a user ID. Once you've received this ID, log into your account and select "Request Access and Activation Code", this will be mailed to your employer.

Lastly, once you have this code, you're ready to log back in and begin to use the service.
