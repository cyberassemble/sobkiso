# LIST OF EU MERCHANTS AND PRINCIPLE OF WORKING WITH THEM

This article will present and analyze European merchandise with which there were successful orders due to bitter and sometimes not very experience. The big advantage of EU shops is that they basically do not see any data other than card number, exp and cvv. Which gives us the opportunity to put on a clean sock under the drop / middle, set up the system and, gently warming up the shop, just drive in the numbers of the card. Also EU shops basically give a lot more amount than the same yusa. The well-known minus is that almost all merchandise is with VBV or Mastercard SecureCode, and therefore you need to look for either bins with autovbv or with reset (there are very few of them left). BUT still, every merch has a vulnerability, and now we will talk about them. 

Banca Sella — This is a VBV merch with a rather weak anti-fraud system, which is easily penetrated by US or UK cards with VBV reset. Some shops use Auto VBV for a certain time of the day or day of the week or a certain bin. 

Adyen — VBV Merch hawks maps of all countries, while there is no SafeKey in it, so discovery and amex for us are a sure way around vbv, and that's half the battle. 

Euro payment service — VBV Merch, USA cards fly in for a reset or UK Non VBV. As for YUSA, you need to know the beans that will skip the transaction. 

Net-a-Porter — Merch of branded clothing stores like YOOX and all the others from the Net A Porter line. Very rarely requests VBV. Almost all EU cards fly in as well as transfers from us mat. The order amount is held and debited from the balance from the moment the pack is sent, which must be taken into account. After the charge, our address is blacklisted. 

Zerogrey — All cards climb, but it is desirable to use fresh bins as always. I recommend registering an account in the shop and if you sent and successfully delivered the pack, then you can squeeze the card to the last. The minus of shops on this merchandise is that they sin with rendering and almost always require it. 

Computop — This is a very simple merch, almost all shops without VBV. Any mat will fly. 

QuickPay, Commdoo, Dibs payment, heidelpay, klik&pay — all these merchandise without VBV, anything goes. 

Qenta — VBV in rare cases (mainly shops without VBV), EU or Exotic climbs like Singapore. 

Skrill — Capricious merch, does not fire billing address. Breaks through EU checkmate and occasionally US.

Safer Pay — SafeKey available, sometimes without VBV. UK volume under reset. 

Sage Pay — VBV is always in all shops. It breaks through AMEX because there is no SafeKey. UK and USA with reset accepts, but not all beans. With successful payment sends in 99% of cases.


PS: When looking for shops, I recommend buying a roller and driving small amounts into shops in order to see how they behave in relation to payment. Whether they hold the amount before sending the pack or write off immediately. Good luck.
