## List of Proxy Services with a description


https://spaceproxy.net/


IPV4 and IPV6 proxies, Russian-speaking technical support, the cost is very cheap, from $0.5 per proxy. Sometimes black proxies come across, but they quickly ref/replace


https://faceless.cc/


The most famous alternative to suites, but much more expensive. The price for a proxy is from $1 to $3, you can pre-check the sock for blacks, mostly everything is clean. Sometimes a sock dies immediately after purchase, and some countries are missing for a couple of hours


https://www.aceproxies.com/


HTTP and SOCKS proxies, the cost of one connection for a month is from $5. There are a lot of blacks on socks, you need to check


https://brightdata.com/


SOCKS and Mobile proxies, the cost of 1 GB of data is from $ 8, but the socks are all very clean, ports and blacks are perfect. Well suited for staff and fraud platforms


https://changemyip.com/


SOCKS proxy, the cost is the same faces, there is a built-in checker, it shows reliably. You can use 1 proxy from several devices at the same time without lags


http://cosmoproxy.com/


HTTP(S) and SOCKS proxies are available, they are quite fast, we did not observe delays and dead proxies immediately after purchase. Payment from a card / stick is also available, so you can drive in

Proxy selling service, VPN for USA Canada and Australia, you can also buy user agents


https://flipnode.io/


Residential proxies, very fast and clean, cost - expensive, very trust to work with BA and stick

A very large range of countries, sometimes stupid, not all clean ones need to be checked before starting to work

Cheap, but not very clean proxies, since a small number of servers will go under spam
