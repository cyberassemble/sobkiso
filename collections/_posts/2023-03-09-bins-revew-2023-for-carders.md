## What is BIN

The term bank identification number (BIN) refers to the first four to six numbers on a payment card. This set of numbers identifies the financial institution that issues the card. As such, it matches transactions to the issuer of the card being used. BINs can be found on various payment cards, including credit cards, charge cards, and debit cards.

The BIN system helps financial institutions identify fraudulent or stolen payment cards and can help prevent identity theft.

## How dose it Works

The bank identification number is a numbering system developed by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) and the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) to identify institutions that issue payment cards. The ANSI is a nonprofit organization (NPO) that creates business standards in the U.S. while the ISO is an international nongovernmental group that creates standards for various industries

All payment cards come with a BIN number. This is a set of four to six numbers randomly assigned to debit cards, credit cards, charge cards, gift cards, electronic benefit cards, and other payment cards. The number is embossed on the front of the card and appears in print just below as well. The first digit specifies the major industry identifier. The digits that follow specify the issuing institution or bank.
 For example, Visa credit cards start with a four, which falls under the banking and financial category.
