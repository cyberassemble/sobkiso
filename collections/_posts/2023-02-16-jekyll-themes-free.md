A collection of awesome (gem-packaged) Jekyll themes - Add your theme!

## Documentation

> Note: Starting with Jekyll 3.2+ Themes can get packaged up into Ruby gems.

See the [(Gem-Packaged) Themes Page @ Jekyll Docs](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/themes) ».


### Intro / Disclaimer

_Gem-Packaged Themes vs. "Classic" Themes_

**Q: How can I get started with gem-packaged themes? / Do I need to package my theme into a gem?**

Gem-packaged themes are just an advanced option and in addition they are in development
for (real world) experiments (e.g. think v0.1 as stated by the Ben Balter - the lead designer / manager / dev at GitHub).

Thus, to conclude do NOT read too much into the official themes docs e.g. as the only or "right" way to design a theme.
Just (continue to) use "classic" themes - there are hundreds to learn from and once you have mastered "classic" themes
you can "graduate" to the master class, that is, using gem-packaged themes.

Again gem-packaged themes are wonderful and welcome -- remember, however, the party is just getting started:

- [henrythemes/hello-minima-theme](https://github.com/henrythemes/hello-minima-theme)

For some "classic" starter themes you may try some of Henry's themes:

- [henrythemes/hello-jekyll-theme](https://github.com/henrythemes/hello-jekyll-theme)
- [henrythemes/jekyll-starter-theme](https://github.com/henrythemes/jekyll-starter-theme)
- [henrythemes/jekyll-starter-theme-v2](https://github.com/henrythemes/jekyll-starter-theme-v2)
- [henrythemes/jekyll-minimal-theme](https://github.com/henrythemes/jekyll-minimal-theme)
- [henrythemes/jekyll-bootstrap-theme](https://github.com/henrythemes/jekyll-bootstrap-theme)

For the "state-of-the-art" what a "classic" theme can do - see the incredible beautiful and
extremely well-documented (incl. a getting started guide and much much more) [Minimal Mistakes (MM) theme](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes) by Michael Rose. Happy Jekylling.
